# Work Day Scheduler

## Purpose 

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash; 5 pm) by modifying the starter code. 

## Additions

A setInterval was added so that if the page is left open and watched it will update the "past, present, and future" classes and therefore change the colour of the page dynamically as it is looking every 5 seconds to see if the time is in the new hour.

## Screenshot of the deployed page

Screenshot is taken at 11:57pm therefore all blocks are grey as they are all past the time of day.
